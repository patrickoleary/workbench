So you've got an awesome idea to throw into Workbench. Great! Please keep the
following in mind:

* If you're creating a small fix or patch to an existing feature, just a simple
  test will do. Please stay in the confines of the current test suite.
* If it's a brand new feature, make sure to create a new feature and appropriate 
  tests. Also, whipping up some documentation in your fork's 
  `gh-pages branch` would be appreciated.
* If your contribution changes any Workbench behavior, make sure to update the
  documentation. It lives in both the source code and the `gh-pages branch`. 
  If the docs are missing information, please feel free to add it in. Great docs 
  make a great project!
* Please do your best to submit **small pull requests**. The easier the proposed
  change is to review, the more likely it will be merged.
* When submitting a pull request, please make judicious use of the pull request
  body. A description of what changes were made, the motivations behind the
  changes and any tasks completed or left to complete will also speed up review 
  time.

Test Dependencies
-----------------

To run the test suite and build the Workbench you'll need to install Workbench's
dependencies. Workbench uses npm, so a quick run of the `npm install` command and
you're all set!

{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install
{% endhighlight %}

Before you start, run the tests and make sure that they pass (to confirm your
environment is configured properly):

{% highlight bash %}
$ grunt test
{% endhighlight %}

Workflow
--------

Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

* Fork the project.
* Clone down your fork:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/<username>/Workbench.git
{% endhighlight %}

* Create a topic branch to contain your change:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout -b my_awesome_feature
{% endhighlight %}


* Hack away, add tests. Not necessarily in that order.
* Make sure everything still passes by running `grunt test`.
* If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
* Push the branch up:

{% highlight bash %}
git push origin my_awesome_feature
{% endhighlight %}

* Create a pull request against Workbench/Workbench:master and describe what your
  change does and the why you think it should be merged.

Updating Documentation
----------------------

We want the Workbench documentation to be the best it can be. We've
open-sourced our docs and we welcome any pull requests if you find it
lacking.

You can find the documentation for Workbench in the
`gh-pages` branch directory of Workbench's repository on GitHub.com.

All documentation pull requests should be directed at `gh-pages`.  Pull
requests directed at another branch will not be accepted.

The [Workbench wiki]({{ site.repository }}/wiki) on GitHub
can be freely updated without a pull request as all
GitHub users have access.

Gotchas
-------

* If you want to bump the dependency versions, please put that in a separate commit.
  This way, the maintainers can control when Workbench gets released.
* Try to keep your patch(es) based from the latest commit on Workbench/Workbench.
  The easier it is to apply your work, the less work the maintainers have to do,
  which is always a good thing.
* Please don't tag your GitHub issue with \[fix\], \[feature\], etc. The maintainers
  actively read the issues and will label it once they come across it.

<div class="note">
  <h5>Let us know what could be better!</h5>
  <p>
    Both using and hacking on Workbench should be fun, simple, and easy, so if for
    some reason you find it’s a pain, please <a
    href="{{ site.repository }}/issues/new">create an issue</a> on
    GitHub describing your experience so we can make it better.
  </p>
</div>
