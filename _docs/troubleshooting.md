## Installation Problems



## Problems running Workbench



## Configuration problems

The order of precedence for conflicting [configuration settings](../configuration/)
is as follows:

1.  Command-line commands
2.  Configuration file settings
3.  Defaults

That is: defaults are overridden by options specified in `config.json`,
and commands specified at the command-line will override all other settings
specified elsewhere.
